![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/Windows10Exploits/blob/master/Undefined/CVE-2020-0757/Howto/ssh_admin.PNG)

To install OpenSSH using PowerShell, first launch PowerShell as an Administrator. To make sure that the OpenSSH features are available for install:

`PowerShell`

```cmd
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
```
- - This should return the following output:
```cmd
Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
```
# Then, install the server and/or client features:

- - Install the OpenSSH Client
```cmd
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
```
- - Install the OpenSSH Server
```cmd
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```
- - Both of these should return the following output:
```cmd
Path          :
Online        : True
RestartNeeded : False
```

# Uninstalling OpenSSH

To uninstall OpenSSH using the Windows Settings, start Settings then go to Apps > Apps and Features > Manage Optional Features. In the list of installed features, select the OpenSSH Client or OpenSSH Server component, then select Uninstall.

To uninstall OpenSSH using PowerShell, use one of the following commands:


`PowerShell`

- - Uninstall the OpenSSH Client
```cmd
Remove-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
```
- - Uninstall the OpenSSH Server
```cmd
Remove-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```


A Windows restart may be required after removing OpenSSH, if the service is in use at the time it was uninstalled.

# Initial Configuration of SSH Server

To configure the OpenSSH server for initial use on Windows, launch PowerShell as an administrator, then run the following commands to start the SSHD service:

`PowerShell`

# Start-Service sshd
- - OPTIONAL but recommended:
```cmd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
```
- Confirm the Firewall rule is configured. It should be created automatically by setup. 
```cmd
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *ssh*
```
- - There should be a firewall rule named "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP", which should be enabled
- - If the firewall does not exist, create one
```cmd
New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
```


# Initial use of SSH
Once you have installed the OpenSSH Server on Windows, you can quickly test it using PowerShell from any Windows device with the SSH Client installed. In PowerShell type the following command:

```cmd
ssh username@servername_IP
```
