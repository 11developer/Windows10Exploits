Publishing PoC code has become controversial because it can lead to zero-day exploits when it is released too quickly. When a PoC code is shared before a weakness is patched, it leaves software and networks vulnerable to hackers. Many large companies have recently fallen victim to security breaches due to PoC codes being shared before issues can be fixed.

As long as the PoC code is published after any weaknesses in the security is patched, a company should not have to worry about putting their cybersecurity at additional risk. In addition to using PoC code later to simulate attacks and identify any possible issues, it also shows that a company is aware of the issue and is confident in its solution to protect itself.
