In Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 version 1809, the the HTTP Trailer Support feature that contains the vulnerability is not active by default. The following registry key must be configured to introduce the vulnerable condition:

```cmd
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters\

"EnableTrailerSupport"=dword:00000001
```
This mitigation does not apply to the other affected versions.
